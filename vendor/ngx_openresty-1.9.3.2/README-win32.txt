    README-win32 - README for the Windows 32-bit build of OpenResty

Description
    The binary distributions of OpenResty can be downloaded from the
    following web page:

    <https://openresty.org/#Download>

    To start the NGINX server of the nginx server of the Win32 binary
    distribution of OpenResty:

     start nginx

    You can also specify the "-p PATH/" option to override the default
    server prefix, as in

     cd /path/to/my/openresty/app/
     start nginx -p $PWD

    Then you can use the "tasklist" command to check the nginx processes
    running in the background:

     C:\> tasklist /fi "imagename eq nginx.exe"
 
     Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage
     ========================= ======== ================ =========== ============
     nginx.exe                     4616 Console                    1      7,412 K
     nginx.exe                     5836 Console                    1      7,800 K

    One of the two processes is the master process while the other is the
    worker.

    If you are using the MSYS bash instead of the "cmd.exe" console, then
    you should replace the "/fi" option with "-fi" in the command above
    instead.

    You can quickly shut down the server like this:

     nginx -s stop

    or gracefully shut it down like this:

     nginx -s quit

    You can also forcibly kill the nginx processes via their PIDs with
    "taskkill", as in

     C:\> taskkill /pid 5488 /F

    where the PID (5488 in this example) can be found via the aforementioned
    "tasklist" command.

    Again, you should use the form "-pid" and "-F" for the options if you
    are in an MSYS bash session.

    Similarly, you can use the "nginx -s reload" command to reload nginx
    configurations without stopping the server. And you can use "nginx -s
    reopen" to instruct nginx to re-open all the log files.

    You can run the "resty" script like this:

     C:\> resty -e "ngx.say('Hello, OpenResty!')"
     Hello, OpenResty!

    The "resty" command-line utility requires a Perl interpreter installed
    in your system and visible to your PATH environment. Any perl
    distributions should work, including StrawberryPerl, ActivePerl, and
    MSYS perl (the former two are recommended though).

Debugging
    Debug symbosl are enabled even in release builds. So that when things go
    very wrong, one can still debug things with tools like MSYS GDB.

    Inclusion of debug symbols make the binary files (".exe" and ".dll"
    files) much larger, but it generally will not load into memory during
    normal execution on a modern operating system.

Caveats
    The Win32 port of the NGINX core supports the good old "select" IO
    multiplexing mechanism only. The I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) feature is
    *not* supported (yet). So do not use this build for production
    environments with very high concurrency levels.

    This Win32 build of OpenResty is mainly for developers who want to
    develop their applications in native Windows environment (though they
    eventually push the finished work onto a Linux or *BSD box, most of the
    time).

TODO
    *   Add support for more than one NGINX worker processes.

    *   Add support for concurrent connections more than 1024.

    *   Switch to the Microsoft Visual Studio compiler toolchain for better
        performance and easier binary package redistribution.

    *   Bundle StrawberryPerl to make command-line utilities like "resty"
        work out of the box (without manually installing a Perl).

    *   Deliver an alternative Win32 binary package built with best debuggin
        capabilities (like enabling NGINX debugging logs, disabling C
        compiler optimizations, and enabling all the assertions and checks).

    *   Deliver binary packages for 64-bit Windows (Win64).

Details About The Building Process
    Usually you do not need to worry about how the Win32 binaries were built
    on the maintainers'' side. But if you do, please read on.

    The Win32 build of OpenResty is currently built via the MinGW/MSYS
    toolchain, including MinGW gcc 4.8.1, MSYS perl, MSYS bash, MSYS make,
    and etc. Basically, it is currently built via the following cmmands:

     mkdir -p objs/lib || exit 1
     cd objs/lib || exit 1
     ls ../../..
     tar -xf ../../../openssl-1.0.2d.tar.gz
     tar -xf ../../../zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
     tar -xf ../../../pcre-8.37.tar.gz
     cd ../..
     ./configure --with-cc=gcc \
         --prefix= \
         --with-cc-opt='-DFD_SETSIZE=1024' \
         --with-select_module \
         --with-ipv6 \
         --sbin-path=nginx.exe \
         --with-pcre-jit \
         --with-luajit-xcflags="-DLUAJIT_NUMMODE=2 -DLUAJIT_ENABLE_LUA52COMPAT" \
         --with-pcre=objs/lib/pcre-8.37 \
         --with-zlib=objs/lib/zlib-1.2.8 \
         --with-openssl=objs/lib/openssl-1.0.2d \
         -j5
     make
     make install

    where the dependency library source tarballs for OpenSSL, Zlib, and PCRE
    are downloaded from their official sites, respectively.

    We automate these commands in a dedicated shell script named
    build-win32.sh
    <https://github.com/openresty/ngx_openresty/blob/master/util/build-win32
    .sh>.

    Furthermore, we automate the packaging process of the resulting binaries
    and supporting files with this package-win32.sh
    <https://github.com/openresty/ngx_openresty/blob/master/util/package-win
    32.sh> script.

    Usually you can just download and use the binary distribution of
    OpenResty without installing the build toolchain.
